# TimeOps

This Project should someday replace my private use of Toogl Track. 
The API is built with Express.js and I also have a React frontend for it. 
You can see a live preview of the frontend 
[here](https://tomsoerr.github.io/TimeOps-Manager-Webapp/) 
(repository [here](https://github.com/TomSoerr/TimeOps-Manager-Webapp)), 
but it is currently not connected to the API. The documentation for the API is 
[here](https://github.com/TomSoerr/TimeOps-Manager-Backend/wiki).
